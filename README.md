# BT Pizza

As a BI Consultant for **BlackTECH’s Pizza**, a Canadian-inspired pizza place in Ontario, I developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to help the restaurant use data to improve **operations, sales, products, and revenue**.

The project analyzed a year of sales data across four tables (**Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, Pizza Types**). Using **data modeling, DAX measures, and storytelling**, I built a dashboard structured into the following sections:

---

## 📊 Executive Summary
High-level KPIs provided leadership with a clear snapshot of performance:
- **Total Revenue:** $818K from 21.3K orders / 50K pizzas sold  
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $38.31 (~2–3 pizzas per order)  
- **Quarterly Revenue Trends** to track business growth  

---

## 📈 Sales Analysis
Insights into demand patterns and revenue drivers:
- **Peak Demand:** Thursdays–Saturdays, especially at lunch and evenings (6–8 PM) → critical for staffing and inventory  
- **Revenue by Category:** Classic ($220K), Supreme ($210K), Chicken ($200K), Veggie ($190K)  
- **Size Mix:** Large pizzas dominate (**46% revenue**), while XL/XXL sizes contribute <2%

## 🍽️ Product Analysis
Performance review of the menu:
- **Top Sellers:** Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken, California Chicken (>$40K each)  
- **Underperformers:** Brie Carre, Spinach Supreme, Calabrese (<$16K each)  
- **Menu Balance:** 32 pizza types with uneven sales → risk of menu bloat  
- **Pricing:** Supreme & Chicken command higher average prices (~$16.8 vs $16.2 for Classic/Veggie)
